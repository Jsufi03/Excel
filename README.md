📊 Data Analysis Project: Finance vs. Information Research & Analysis Sectors 🔍

Welcome to my data analysis project! Here, I explore the fascinating world of Finance 💸 and Information Research & Analysis (IRA) 📚 sectors using real-world data from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) 📈. This project dives deep into employment trends, gender representation, pay distribution, and more to reveal the key differences and similarities between these two critical industries.


🔨 What I Did:
Using datasets from 2012 to 2021 📆, I analyzed various aspects of the workforce in both Finance and IRA sectors, such as:

Gender Representation 👩‍💼👨‍💼
Full-time vs. Part-time Employment ⏳
Education Levels 🎓
Pay Distributions 💰
Through pivot tables, descriptive statistics, and visualizations, I created insights that showcase the workforce dynamics across these sectors. Here’s a breakdown of the key findings! 👇

💡 Techniques Used:
Data Cleaning & Transformation 🧹: Handled missing values and categorized educational attainment (college degree vs. non-college degree) to ensure accuracy.

Descriptive Statistics & Pivot Tables 📊: Leveraged Excel’s pivot tables to slice data by gender, employment type, and education levels for easy comparisons.

Visualizations 🖼️: Used histograms 📊, bar charts 📈, and pivot tables 📑 to visually represent findings like regional pay distributions and workforce demographics.

🎯 Key Insights:
Gender Disparities ⚖️: In the Finance sector, males dominate, whereas in IRA, gender representation is much more balanced ⚖️.

Employment Type 💼: Both sectors favor full-time employment 🕒, but IRA offers more part-time flexibility 🕓.

Education & Earnings 🎓💷: Workers with a college degree are prevalent in both sectors, but Finance workers typically earn more 💰, especially in London and the South East 🌍.

🚀 Challenges I Overcame:
Balancing data across multiple years 📅 and creating consistent categories (like grouping education levels) was no easy task, but with careful data cleaning and formula checks, I ensured precise and reliable results! ✅

🔍 Conclusion:
Through this project, I not only enhanced my skills in data analysis 📊 and visualization 📈 but also learned to uncover stories hidden in the data 📜. From gender disparities to pay differences, this analysis provides valuable insights for anyone interested in understanding workforce trends in Finance and IRA.
